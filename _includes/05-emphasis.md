# github
GitHub is a _**code hosting platform for version control and collaboration**_. It lets you and others* work together on projects from anywhere*. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

## the things I 💙 in gihub :octocat:
* you can **_host_ your works for free** and share it 💻
* GitHub makes it **easy to have multiple contributors 👨‍👦‍👦 work** on the *same project*
* you could start **blogs** by using *github pages* 🌹
### *and many more ❤️‍🔥*
